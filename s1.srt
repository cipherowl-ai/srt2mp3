1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:04,708
Let me demonstrate the CipherOwl Watcher, and Explorer.

2
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:10,083
CipherOwl Watcher is a Chrome extension working together with our SaaS product.

3
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:15,583
Here we have a high-risk address to examine.

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:21,166
This address has been exposed to an entity called Excoino, which is marked as sanctioned.

5
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:28,416
Let's examine the metadata here.
Our proprietary model

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:34,916
filters out less likely labels,
such as ransom label in this case.

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,625
You can review the history
to see the origin of these labels, when they were collected, where they are from,and how they evolved.

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:48,208
Moving to transactions, you'll see
a complete list of activities.

9
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,458
Each entry represents a transaction
for this particular address.

10
00:00:53,458 --> 00:01:01,500
You can navigate through transactions
by clicking and exploring each one. 

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,875
Not only that, you can track
each specific UTXO's origin.

12
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:15,583
and destination in the system. 
We call this "infinite flow". It is super powerful for fund tracing.

13
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:26,375
You can trace each address in the flows like this,
and check address risks with CipherOwl Watcher, let's try it out!

14
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,500
CipherOwl Watcher has identified
84 BTC addresses on this page.
CipherOwl Watcher is capable of scanning the thousands of addresses in a few seconds, in batch risk assessment mode.

15
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:41,666
With one click, we can scan
and analyze all these addresses.

16
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:48,000
We can sort and examine
each case individually.

17
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:59,333
Here are the detailed exposure metrics, which we can visualize in graphs too.
Let's click the reporting generation to ask AI to generate a report, it will take 15 seconds, will come back to this later.

18
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:15,000
In the transaction panel, addresses were highlighed by the CipherOwl Watcher:
Red for high risk,
Green for low risk,
Yellow for medium risk.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,333
Let's examine why this particular
address shows medium risk.

20
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:28,041
We can analyze its exposure... as you can see, it is marked as noKYC, that means it is related to a KYC-free service.

21
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:35,041
Last, here is the report generated by our AI agent. Will come back to this in a separate video. That concludes our demonstration. Thank you!
